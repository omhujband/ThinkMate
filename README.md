## ✨ Key Features

### 📄 Smart Document Processing
- **Local PDF Indexing**: Upload your study materials once. ThinkMate extracts and chunks the text locally, allowing the AI to "read" and reference your specific documents during study sessions.
- **History Management**: Keep track of all your materials in a sleek history list. Delete or clear the entire cache with a single tap.

### 🗣️ "Talk About It" – Voice Interaction
- **Hands-Free Conversation**: A seamless, continuous voice interface. No need to press the mic for every turn—just talk, and the AI will listen, process, and reply.
- **Resilient Speech-to-Text**: High-accuracy local STT (Whisper-based) optimized for 16kHz mono audio.

### 🧩 Concept Simplifier
- **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: Stuck on a difficult chapter? ThinkMate breaks down complex concepts from your material into simple, numbered steps with clear analogies.
- **Context-Aware**: Explanations are strictly grounded in your provided document to ensure accuracy.

### 📝 Interactive Quiz Mode
- **Structured Learning**: The AI generates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) mapped directly to your material.
- **Real-Time Grading**: Get instant feedback on your answers.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Once revealed, the AI provides a full explanation of why an answer is correct.

## 🔒 Privacy & Offline First
- **Zero Internet Requirement**: Once the initial models are downloaded, ThinkMate functions entirely without a data connection.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Your PDFs and conversations never leave your device. We use local model storage for the LLM (Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct), STT (Whisper), and TTS engines.
